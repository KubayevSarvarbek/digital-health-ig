== Suppressed Messages ==

# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)
# See https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig/blob/master/input/ignoreWarnings.txt for examples

# This recommendation does not apply to these examples as they are not clinical observations.
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# No R5 DICOM package exists yet, but we have to depend on it for our DICOM supplement to resolve correctly - known issue, reported
This IG is version 5.0.0, while the IG 'fhir.dicom' is from version 4.0.1
The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 5.0.0 but package fhir.dicom#2025.2.20250411 is based on FHIR version 4.0.1. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try

# IG publisher can't find supplements for ISO 3166 - this can be ignored
The value provided ('UZ') was not found in the value set 'ISO 3166 2 character codes in Uzbek and Russian' (https://terminology.dhp.uz/fhir/core/ValueSet/iso-3166-2-uz-vs%

# This is not a canonical URL, but an instance URL and should not be checked - reported
No definition could be found for URL value 'https://dhp.uz/fhir/core'

# Lack of translations for sample instances - this is OK
"The narrative includes custom content for the default language (en), but does not include translated content for the ru language, so the default language has been used
"The narrative includes custom content for the default language (en), but does not include translated content for the uz language, so the default language has been used

# ISO 3166 is not a codesystem with all of its codes explicitly defined, this is expected
Source Code System urn:iso:std:iso:3166 doesn't have all content (content = not-present), so the source codes cannot be checked
Target Code System urn:iso:std:iso:3166 doesn't have all content (content = not-present), so the target codes cannot be checked

# IdentifierDomain uses codes from other codesystems, which are being incorrectly checked against itself (instead of checking the codes against the original systems where they come from)
