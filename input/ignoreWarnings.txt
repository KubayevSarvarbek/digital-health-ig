== Suppressed Messages ==

# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)
# See https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig/blob/master/input/ignoreWarnings.txt for examples

Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# No R5 DICOM package exists yet, but we have to depend on it for our DICOM supplement to resolve correctly - known issue, reported
This IG is version 5.0.0, while the IG 'fhir.dicom' is from version 4.0.1
The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 5.0.0 but package fhir.dicom#2025.2.20250411 is based on FHIR version 4.0.1. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try
